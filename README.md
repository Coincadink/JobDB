This project is designed to serve as a tool which when run will fetch all jobs from a companies job page. These jobs are scraped by a unique scraper for each company and then loaded into a database in order to track new jobs and help stay up to date on onpportunities!

I recommend you run the project using uv to create a venv:

```Python console
uv venv --python 3.13
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv run src/main.py
```
